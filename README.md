# Snake-Water-and-Gun-Game
Snake Water Gun is one of the famous two-player game played by many people.
It is a hand game in which the player randomly chooses any of the three forms i.e. snake, water, and gun.
Here, I am going to implement this game using python.
This python project is to build a game for a single player that plays with the computer .
Following rules for the game:
1. Snake vs. Water: Snake drinks the water hence wins.
2.Water vs. Gun: The gun will drown in water, hence a point for water
3.Gun vs. Snake: Gun will kill the snake and win.

In situations where both players choose the same object, the result will be a tie.
